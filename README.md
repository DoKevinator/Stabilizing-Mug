# Stabilizing-Mug
Senior Design Stabilizing Mug

We wanted to create a project that could benefit the world. So we decided to create a stabilizing mug for Parkinson's Disease patients. There are many products on the market today that helps Parkinson's disease patients, such as LiftWare (a Google sponsored project), a stabilizing spoon. This helps people with hand tremors eat food at peace without worrying about spilling it. We set out to create a device that can do the same, but for drinks. 

Created over the course of 2 quarters (Fall 2015 and Winter 2016). Worked in a team of 4 people (3 EE's and myself, a CSE student). Written mostly in C++, and some native Arduino language. Professor Pat Chu. Used servo motors, Arduino Uno, MPU6050 accelerometer & gyroscope, and miscellaneous hardware.
